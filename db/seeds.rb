# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
#Product.create(name: "bike", price: 699.99, image_url: "https://www.ghost-bikes.com/fileadmin/_processed_/8/c/csm_ghost-bikes-Riot-Trail-essential-black-black-45_38d9fe71b8.png", description: "its a bike")
